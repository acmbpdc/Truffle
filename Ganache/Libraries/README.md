## TensorFlow
TensorFlow is one of the best library available for working with Machine Learning on Python. Offered by Google, TensorFlow makes ML model building easy for beginners and professionals alike.

Using TensorFlow, you can create and train ML models on not just computers but also mobile devices and servers by using TensorFlow Lite and TensorFlow Serving that offers the same benefits but for mobile platforms and high-performance servers.

## Theano 
Theano is a powerful Python library enabling easy defining, optimizing and evaluation of powerful mathematical expressions. With Theano, you can achieve the rapid development of some of the most efficient machine learning algorithms. 

Built on top of Theano are some of the well known deep learning libraries such as Keras, Blocks and Lasagne. Theano is a Python library and optimizing compiler for manipulating and evaluating mathematical expressions, especially matrix-valued ones. In Theano, computations are expressed using a NumPy-esque syntax and compiled to run efficiently on either CPU or GPU architectures.

Theano Is no longer under development see GitHub page for more.
