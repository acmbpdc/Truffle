# Machine Learning Frameworks

Machine Learning relies on algorithms. Unless you’re a data scientist or ML expert, these algorithms are very complicated to understand and work with.

A machine learning framework, then, simplifies machine learning algorithms. An ML framework is any tool, interface, or library that lets you develop ML models easily, without understanding the underlying algorithms.

There are a variety of machine learning frameworks, geared at different purposes. Nearly all ML the frameworks—those we discuss here and those we don’t—are written in Python. Python is the predominant machine learning programming language.

## Apache Mahout
Apache Mahout is a project of the Apache Software Foundation to produce free implementations of distributed or otherwise scalable machine learning algorithms focused primarily on linear algebra. In the past, many of the implementations use the Apache Hadoop platform, however today it is primarily focused on Apache Spark. Mahout also provides Java/Scala libraries for common maths operations (focused on linear algebra and statistics) and primitive Java collections. Mahout is a work in progress; a number of algorithms have been implemented.

## Chainer
Chainer is an open source deep learning framework written purely in Python on top of NumPy and CuPy Python libraries. The development is led by Japanese venture company Preferred Networks in partnership with IBM, Intel, Microsoft, and Nvidia.

Chainer is notable for its early adoption of "define-by-run" scheme, as well as its performance on large scale systems. The first version was released in June 2015 and has gained large popularity in Japan since then. Furthermore, in 2017, it was listed by KDnuggets in top 10 open source machine learning Python projects.
